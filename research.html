					<div class="research-abstract">
						The main purpose of this study was to outline the current situation of students’ early alert systems (EAS) in Taiwanese universities. We explored the following questions: (1) What types of EAS have been established in universities in Taiwan? (2) What are the main functions and mechanisms of the current EAS? (3) What are the actual uses of EAS in universities? (4) What are the possible restrictions on and solutions for using EAS? Data were gathered from 56 public and private universities in Taiwan. Experts familiar with or in charge of EAS design, development, and use in these universities were interviewed by telephone or face-to-face. We found that although the utility rate of EAS in most universities tended to be high, faculty resistance and difficulty in follow-up assessments on EAS utilization were the two common restrictions that occurred across campuses. To enhance the use effectiveness of EAS, faculty and administrators from both departmental and institutional levels should be involved. In addition, this study suggested that in the future, universities must attempt to strengthen collaboration among units related to EAS, improve the evaluation of EAS effectiveness, and provide additional early alert indicators of students’ academic performance.

						This study aims to identify the performance problem associated with the office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and provide an intervention to alleviate the performance problem by leveraging the resources of DEI. For this purpose, this study conducted a needs analysis and the methodology was a mixed method. Data was collected from documents, one-on-one interviews with each Assistant Dean and a student ambassador, observations on DEI’s events, and a survey of 56 students. From this data, SWOT and Force Field analysis was conducted. The findings are as follows. First, it was identified that the performance problem is the difficulty in maintaining consistent communication between DEI and students. Second, it is suggested that declaring and explaining the purpose of DEI’s activity to make students aware of it by improving the quality of written and oral information as a possible solution in order to improve the consistency of communication between DEI and them.

					<div class="research-abstract">
						Advising should be a collaborative work between faculty advisors and stakeholders from other advising sectors across the organization. This survey study evaluates the effectiveness of collaborative advising via an online platform from the faculty advisors’ perspective. The results indicate that while most faculty respondents consider that online collaborative advising benefits their advising work regarding the accomplishment, positive relationships, and engagement, their perceptions of effectiveness are only influenced by their actual usage of the function. Neither faculty advisors’ prior advising experiences nor possible technology familiarity have a significant impact on their agreement on online collaborative advising effectiveness.

					<div class="research-abstract">
						This research topic combines historical data and visualization tools, based on Professor Kuo-tai Hu's book "Rebirth in the Fire: Higher Education in the War Time China" published in 2004 by the Institute of Modern History at the Academia Sinica. It attempts to present the difficulties of maintaining higher education in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War through the data visualization tool Tableau. The visualization results presented here are mainly three types: one is the property loss brought to each university by the war; the second is the basic data of university relocation, including the number and the main relocation routes; the third is the move of university students from the coastal area to the inland. Through these three data, we can understand the impact of war on modern higher education in China.

							With the competition of higher education and the proficiency of information technology, universities at Taiwan and the United States are all actively setting up  "Early Alert System", hoping to effectively grasp the learning situation of students and provide appropriate counseling and remediation at the early stage of the problem. This paper analyses and compares the current situation of the construction of the Early Alert System in the Taiwan and United States, sums up the characteristics of both sides, and puts forward the future development direction and optimization suggestions for Taiwan's universities.
