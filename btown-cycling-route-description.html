<h1>Bloomington Cycling Tour Map</h1>

<p>
The Bloomington Cycling Tour Map is a portrait format which can be printed out in a paper of A4 size. It is divided into three sections. Starting from the top, the first section provides cycling safety tips, followed by cycling route information in the second section, and a diagram of elevation and distance between the checkpoints on the cycling route in the third section.
<p>
The cycling safety tips section provides helpful advice for a safe and enjoyable cycling experience. It recommends that cyclists should know to call 9-1-1 in case of emergencies, pass buses on the left while keeping an eye out for right turns, and wear bright blinking lights when cycling at night.
</p>
<p>In the middle is the cycling route information section, the main part of this infographic, featuring a street map that shows traffic information for Bloomington, including the Indiana University campus. The map is labeled with different tags at the top to indicate different types of sites: green for cycling routes, gray for streets other than cycling routes, blue for creeks, yellow for public areas such as schools or parks, and orange for tour spots and cycling checkpoints. In the top right corner of the map, there is a compass that indicates north. Additionally, the traffic information includes the name of every street, famous local spots as checkpoints, and detailed descriptions of some unique landmarks and facilities. The cycling route is highlighted in green and is fully detailed below:
</p>
<p>Start your cycling tour at Sample Gates on Indiana Avenue and head north. Turn right onto 7th Street and continue heading east, passing the Emie Ptled Hall and the IU Auditorium on your right. At the intersection of Eagleson Avenue and 7th Street, turn right onto Eagleson Avenue and continue heading south, passing the Music Art Center on your left. When you reach the intersection of Eagleson Avenue and 3rd Street, you will find Soma Coffee, a local coffee shop that has been serving high-quality coffee and drinks for over 20 years. Soma Coffee is well-loved by locals for its community-oriented approach, as it sponsors and contributes to different Bloomington community organizations each month. 
</p>
<p>After leaving Soma Coffee, continue heading south and turn right onto E Sheridan Drive. Head west and cross the intersection at S Woodlawn Avenue to enter Bryan Park. Bryan Park is one of Bloomington's most popular parks, covering 33 acres of green space. Visitors can enjoy a range of facilities, including the Bryan Park Pool, a baseball field, basketball and tennis courts, shelters available for rent, and playgrounds. The park is also home to Sheridan Creek, which runs through its scenic trails. 
</p>
<p>After entering the park, head towards the trail by Sheridan Creek and follow it until you arrive at S Henderson Street. Turn right onto S Henderson Street and head north for a bit before turning left onto E Allen Street. Continue heading west on E Allen Street until you reach the Bloomington Rail Trail/B-Line Trail. This trail used to be run by the former CSX Railroad for over a century but has since been converted into a smooth, tarmacked path for running, walking, cycling, and skateboarding.
</p>
<p>
    Continue heading north on the B-Line Trail, passing cycling checkpoints like Hopscotch Coffee, Kroger Supermarket, and the Monroe Convention Center. Keep going north, and when you reach W 4th Street, you'll find Wonderland Lab Science Museum on your left. The museum features live science shows and demonstrations, as well as introduces stories of the science and math behind our everyday lives. 
</p>
<p>Keep heading north until you reach the intersection of B-Line Trail and W 7th Street, where you'll find Bloomington Bike Project, a local store offering services such as bicycle repair, maintenance classes, and Earn-A-Bike activities. Turn right onto W 7th Street and head east, then turn right onto N Lincoln Street. Keep heading south, passing checkpoints like Butch’s and CVS, before turning left onto W Kirkwood Avenue. Follow Kirkwood Avenue east until you reach the Monroe Public Library, which is also the end of the cycling route. The library is open to everyone and offers free services, such as book and media borrowing, events and exhibitions, adult education, and more.
</p>
<p>The final section of the Bloomington Cycling Tour Map features a diagram showing the elevation and distance between the eight checkpoints on the route. The total climb of the route is 128 feet, and the total descent is 141 feet. The route begins with a slightly climb from Sample Gates to IU Auditorium (0.6 miles), followed by another ascent from IU Auditorium to the highest point, Soma Coffee (0.5 miles). From there, cyclists will descend to Bryan Park (1.1 miles) and then to the lowest point on the route, B-Line Trail (0.6 miles). After a slight climb from B-Line Trail to Wonderland Lab Science Museum (0.7 miles), the route becomes mostly flat from there to Bloomington Bike Project (0.2 miles). The last stretch of the route ascends slightly from Bloomington Bike Project and then descends to the endpoint, Monroe Public Library (0.5 miles). The entire route covers a distance of 4.2 miles and can be completed in approximately 23 minutes.
